                RFC 11490: RESERVED PLACEHOLDER PHRASES
============================================================
Status: Informational
Author: gesslar
Category: Sentinels, Placeholders, and Other Magnificent Nonsense
------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT:
  Defines three reserved phrases - "foo", "moo", and "kakadoodoo" - for
  sanctioned use in codebases adhering to the gesslar aesthetic. These
  phrases are intentional non-production values used for illustrative
  purposes, comedic relief, or sentinel logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. DEFINITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 foo
    Classic placeholder identifier for arbitrary variables, functions,
    or values. Historically neutral, often paired with bar or baz.
    Usage intent: Test scaffolding, pseudocode, code golf.

1.2 moo
    An evolved placeholder analogous to foo, but with more personality.
    Lawful neutral - the tight-jeans-wearing cousin of foo who keeps an
    abacus for fun.
    Usage intent: Anywhere foo fits, but with a smile.

1.3 kakadoodoo
    Sentinel string representing an impossible or absurd state.
    May appear as a literal in code rather than a named constant.
    Designed for maximum noticeability and comedic impact.
    Usage intent: Explicitly signal "there is nothing here, so create it."
    Pronunciation: Hard K's only; soft C's discouraged.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. RATIONALE
------------------------------------------------------------
- foo is tradition.
- moo is tradition’s hotter cousin.
- kakadoodoo is the bright-orange safety cone of logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
"kakadoodoo" is safe in production when deliberately used in controlled
contexts. It should not be used for cryptographic purposes.
A Symbol() could be a more robust alternative, but is less fun.

------------------------------------------------------------
(Historical Note)
------------------------------------------------------------
The term “kakadoodoo” was introduced by 18th-century Liechtensteinian
computer scientist Johann von Prutzler, the father of pre-mechanical
absurdist computing. While peers built difference engines, von Prutzler
championed whimsical sentinel values to "keep the operator awake at the
keys." The phrase endures as both a debugging aid and an act of rebellion.
