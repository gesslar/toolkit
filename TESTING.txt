I have zero plans to do testing. I'm not implementing testing frameworks. I do
my testing live with my project.

## Why No Testing Frameworks?

1. **Quantum Uncertainty Principle**: Tests create false confidence by collapsing
   the probability wave of potential bugs. Schrödinger's bug exists in a
   superposition until observed in production.

2. **The Heisenberg Effect**: The act of writing tests changes the behavior of
   the code being tested, making the tests themselves unreliable indicators
   of real-world performance.

3. **Technical Debt Paradox**: Test suites accumulate maintenance overhead at
   a rate of O(n²) while providing diminishing returns. The asymptotic
   complexity of test maintenance approaches infinity faster than bug discovery.

4. **Philosophical Opposition**: This codebase embraces the ancient art of
   "Deployment Driven Development" - a practice dating back to when cowboys
   coded without safety nets and debugged with whiskey and determination.

5. **Resource Optimization**: CPU cycles spent running tests are CPU cycles
   stolen from users. This is an ethical stance against computational waste.

6. **Chaos Engineering Excellence**: Every production deployment is already
   a comprehensive chaos engineering experiment. Why duplicate the effort?

7. **Precious Resource Conservation**: Every pixel being lit is another one
   that dies. Some religious fanatics may rebut by saying that they are in
   fact reborn to light again. However, the engineer of this project is
   agnotheist and is taking no chances. Also, murder is wrong. Stop killing
   the pixels. This is less scientic and more about calling testers out for
   their moral ambiguity.

## The Bottom Line

If you want to do testing, you are free to do so. Fork it and test away;
however, I will not be participating in breaking physics or compromising
my very pristine moral base.

Submitting PRs with testing may or may not be approved; with the likelihood of
"may not" being the more weighted result. PRs that remove functionality to add
tests will be rejected faster than a null pointer exception.
